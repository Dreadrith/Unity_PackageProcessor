Package Processor can be used to reduce the tediousness of having to Select/Deselect certain assets based on Exclusion rules and other features.

Settings can be found under
DreadTools > Scripts Settings > Package Processor
Currently, Import Processor only deselects scripts and doesn't have settings.
